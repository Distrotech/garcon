0.1.0
=====
- This is a complete rewrite of the former Xfce menu library called 
  libxfce4menu. It covers almost every part of the menu specification
  except for legacy menus and a few XML attributes. In contrast to 
  libxfce4menu, it can also load menus modified with menu editors such
  as Alacarte as menu merging is now supported. The only crucial 
  feature still missing is monitoring menus and menu items for changes.
  This is something that will be worked on for the next release.
