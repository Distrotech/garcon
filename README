What is it?
===========

This is garcon, a freedesktop.org compliant menu implementation based
on GLib and GIO.


Current state
=============

garcon already covers the most important parts of the menu specification. 
It is however still in development and thus, neither stable nor complete.


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.


Debugging Support
=================

garcon currently supports three different levels of debugging support, 
which can be setup using the configure flag `--enable-debug' (check the output 
of `configure --help'):

  `yes'         This is the default for SVN snapshot builds. It adds all kinds
                of checks to the code, and is therefore likely to run slower.
                Use this for development of garcon and locating bugs in 
                garcon.

  `minimum'     This is the default for release builds. This is the recommended
                behaviour.

  `no'          Disables all sanity checks. Don't use this unless you know
                exactly what you do.


How to report bugs?
===================

Bugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system 
(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product garcon). You will need to create an 
account for yourself.

Please read the HACKING file for information on where to send changes or 
bugfixes for this package.
