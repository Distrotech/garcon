{"name":"Garcon","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.xfce.org/xfce/garcon","body":"What is it?\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis is garcon, a freedesktop.org compliant menu implementation based\r\non GLib and GIO. It was started as a complete rewrite of the former \r\nXfce menu library called libxfce4menu, which, in contrast to garcon, \r\nwas lacking menu merging features essential for loading menus modified \r\nwith menu editors.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent state\r\n=============\r\n\r\nGarcon covers almost every part of the menu specification except for\r\nlegacy menus and a few XML attributes. In contrast to \r\nlibxfce4menu, it can also load menus modified with menu editors such\r\nas Alacarte as menu merging is now supported. The only crucial \r\nfeature still missing is monitoring menus and menu items for changes.\r\nThis is something that will be worked on for the next release.\r\n\r\nThe garcon API will most likely not be frozen until its 1.0.0 release!\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDebugging Support\r\n=================\r\n\r\ngarcon currently supports three different levels of debugging support, \r\nwhich can be setup using the configure flag `--enable-debug' (check the output \r\nof `configure --help'):\r\n\r\n  `yes'         This is the default for SVN snapshot builds. It adds all kinds\r\n                of checks to the code, and is therefore likely to run slower.\r\n                Use this for development of garcon and locating bugs in \r\n                garcon.\r\n\r\n  `minimum'     This is the default for release builds. This is the recommended\r\n                behaviour.\r\n\r\n  `no'          Disables all sanity checks. Don't use this unless you know\r\n                exactly what you do.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to report bugs?\r\n===================\r\n\r\nBugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system \r\n(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product Garcon). You will need to create an \r\naccount for yourself.\r\n\r\nPlease read the HACKING file for information on where to send changes or \r\nbugfixes for this package.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
